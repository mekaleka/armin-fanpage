As one of my first projects this excites me a lot. Creating something that is reflecting what I truly love, and that is music. This project is one that drives me to be better at what I do in my coding career. It is simple and I will continue to update it as time goes on but it is an example of my early work. I was challenged with a few tasks on this one and created things like a table, also created other elements like list groups and a bio for my favorite artist. I used css to add some background color. This project inspires me to keep going and continue to advance. 
Future development may include some social media links and more attention to detail in css and js.
